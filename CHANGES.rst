Changelog
=========

Unreleased
----------
- Drop python 3.7 support and add support for python 3.12. Supported versions are now: 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12. `#197 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-factoryboy/pull/197>`_
- Drop support for pytest < 6.2. We now support only pytest >= 6.2 (tested against pytest 7.4 at the time of writing). `#197 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-factoryboy/pull/197>`_

2.5.1
----------
- Fix PytestDeprecationWarning. `#180 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-factoryboy/pull/180>`_ `#179 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-factoryboy/issues/179>`_

2.5.0
----------
- Using a generic class container like ``dict``, ``list``, ``set``, etc. will raise a warning suggesting you to wrap your model using ``named_model(...)``. Doing this will make sure that the fixture name is correctly chosen, otherwise SubFactory and RelatedFactory aren't able to determine the name of the model. See `Generic Container Classes as models <https://pytest-factoryboy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#generic-container-classes-as-models>`_ `#167 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-factoryboy/pull/167>`_
- Fix ``Factory._after_postgeneration`` being invoked twice. `#164 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-factoryboy/pull/164>`_ `#156 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-factoryboy/issues/156>`_
- Stack traces caused by pytest-factoryboy are now slimmer. `#169 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-factoryboy/pull/169>`_
- Check for naming conflicts between factory and model fixture name, and raise a clear error immediately. `#86 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-factoryboy/pull/86>`_

2.4.0
----------
- ``LazyFixture`` is now a Generic[T] type.
- Simplify fixture generation (internal change).
- Use poetry (internal change).

2.3.1
----------
- Fix AttributeError when using LazyFixture in register(...) `#159 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-factoryboy/issues/159>`_ `#158 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-factoryboy/issues/158>`_


2.3.0
----------
- Add support for ``factory.PostGenerationMethodCall`` `#103 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-factoryboy/pull/103>`_ `#87 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-factoryboy/issues/87>`_.


2.2.1
----------
- ``@register()`` decorator now refuses kwargs after the initial specialization. This behaviour was mistakenly introduced in version 2.2.0, and it complicates the usage of the ``register`` function unnecessarily. For example, the following is not allowed anymore:

.. code-block:: python

    # INVALID
    register(
        _name="second_author",
        name="C.S. Lewis",
    )(
        AuthorFactory,
        register_user="cs_lewis",
        register_user__password="Aslan1",
    )

    # VALID
    register(
        AuthorFactory,
        _name="second_author",
        name="C.S. Lewis",
        register_user="cs_lewis",
        register_user__password="Aslan1",
    )


2.2.0
----------
- Drop support for Python 3.6. We now support only python >= 3.7.
- Improve "debuggability". Internal pytest-factoryboy calls are now visible when using a debugger like PDB or PyCharm.
- Add type annotations. Now ``register`` and ``LazyFixture`` are type annotated.
- Fix `Factory._after_postgeneration <https://factoryboy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference.html#factory.Factory._after_postgeneration>`_ method not getting the evaluated ``post_generations`` and ``RelatedFactory`` results correctly in the ``result`` param.
- Factories can now be registered inside classes (even nested classes) and they won't pollute the module namespace.
- Allow the ``@register`` decorator to be called with parameters:

.. code-block:: python

    @register
    @register("other_author")
    class AuthorFactory(Factory):
        ...
